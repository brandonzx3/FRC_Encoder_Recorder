    <h2>What is the FRC Encoder Recorder?</h2>
    <p>the FRC Encoder Recorder is a labview library written to make the use of motor encoders simple.</p>
    <p>use the record vi's to record encoder distance then use the execute vi's to move the motor to that encoder distance</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How To Use</h4>
    <p>all the thing you need are inside of two virtual folders</p>
    <img src="images/Screenshot_1.jpg">
